# EZ Delivery Mod
![lol](https://i.imgur.com/EQlXp3S.png)

This is a fairly simple mod for Supermarket Simulator that allows for you to NOT spend 20 minutes before opening the shop everyday by creating a simple way to magically beam boxes onto rack slots from the street!

I'm aware this is sort of a "cheaty" mod if you will, however, the game devs have said in future restockers will be able to pick up boxes from the streets. In the meantime, if you're lazy then simply use this mod!

All you have to do is pick up a box from the street, press "L" on your keyboard and if there is sufficient rack space for that specific product the box will teleport to the rack - you're a wizard!

Please bare in mind this is my first mod for this game, took me a couple hours of head scratching when boxes were no longer interactable after being placed in the rack (which is now fixed) so if there are any bugs that I haven't spotted do not hesitate to let me know :)

# Changing Keybinds
In the lastest version you can now change the keybind to rack an item.
In order to do this, navigate to the MelonPreferences.cfg file﻿ in the UserData folder
Scroll down until you find the EZDelivery category and you can change the key there:

# Requirements
This mod requires MelonLoader, which can be found [here](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/)﻿.
There are plenty of tutorials around on how to set up MelonLoader if you get stuck!
After downloading, the EZDelivery.dll file is to be placed in your new "Mods" folder in your game directory.
